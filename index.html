      <p>Here at Florida Fine Cut, we live by the words; <strong>quality, trust, </strong>and <strong>dependability.</strong> We have heard so many horror stories of magical landscapers who are able to disappear! We would never abandon your or your lawn and landscaping needs. <br><br>
      Florida Fine Cut offers the best residential lawn care service in Palm Beach County. We are able to provide weekly maintenence for your lawn, we can also provide fertilizing and pest control services. We maintain your lawn as if it was our own and take great pride in keeping your grass trimmed and green, all year round. We don't cut any corners like other landscape agencies, we string-trim and edge during every visit. We vow to never blow grass clippings into the road or your driveway, that's for amateurs. <br><br>
      We offer additional services such as hedge-trimming and tree-trimming. We love seeing a well-maintained palm tree! <br><br>
